            <h2>What is your favorite ice cream flavor?</h2>
            <p>Mint. And not that bright green kind of mint—the actual mint, the kind that is off-white in color.</p>

            <h2>A Boring Fact About Me</h2>
            <p>I do not like to go to big social events.</p>

        <section id="slang-section">
            <h2>Slang That Needs to Stop</h2>
            <p><strong>"Rizz"</strong></p>
            <p>It sounds ridiculous in a professional setting and makes communication feel less genuine. Let's go back to saying "charisma" or "charm."</p>

        <section id="article-section">
            <h2>A Recent Read</h2>
            <p>I recently read an article about the future of VR hardware.</p>
            <a href="https://www.theverge.com/vr-ar" target="_blank">Read the article here</a>
            <p>I liked it because it discusses how mixed reality is finally becoming accessible to regular consumers, which matches my experience with the Quest 3.</p>
